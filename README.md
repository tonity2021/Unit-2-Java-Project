# Online-Travel-Booking-App
## Project Concept:

![passport-2714675_640](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94870846/152490274-15546bcf-cf8a-454a-b6e1-373370af1cbe.jpg)

This app represents a real-life online travel booking system which allows a user to make travel reservations and a user profile through a set of endpoints and HTTP requests. Prior to making the reservation, a user is able to register with their username, email, and password.  After they have registered, they can subsequently sign in and a JWT (JSON web token) is returned as a way of authorizing and protecting the client server session. After signing in, a user can create a reservation, modify their reservation and ultimately cancel it if necessary.  In addition, a user can create a user profile connecting them to their travel reservation.  User information is stored in a PostgreSQL database and facilitated by PGAdmin.  

Ultimately I was able to achieve this project through a variety of outside tools: using Word document to track my goals and progress, creating an ERD, and making multiple commits via Git Bash to keep track of recent changes to my project.
